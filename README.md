An "Algorithm and Data Structure" exercise solved to O(n)

# typescript

Typescript was used for tests in order to find an efficient solution. To use it, install NodeJS, go to ts folder, run "npm i" on that folder, run "npm run serve n" where "n" is the number of test you want to perform (1-12).

# c++

Here there is the solution. After compiling it, run the executable file with two arguments: the first is the N size of the input that will be generated, the second is a boolean that says if you want to write the solution.
